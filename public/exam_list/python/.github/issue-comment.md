​		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ❗ Run checks on the whole repo & submit a bunch of PRs.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This creates longer review cycles & exhausts reviewers energy & time.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may also conflict with ongoing changes from other contributors.  
​		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ❗ Insert only blank lines, make a closing bracket drop to the next line, change a word  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to a synonym without obvious reason, or add trailing space that's not an[ EOL][EOL] for the very end of text files.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ❗ Introduce arbitrary changes "just to change things" .

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _...These sorts of things are **not** considered helpful, and will likely be closed by reviewers._

- _Here to suggest a feature or new exercise??_ **Hooray!** Please keep in mind [_Chesterton's Fence_][chestertons-fence].  
_Thoughtful suggestions will likely result faster & more enthusiastic responses from maintainers._
