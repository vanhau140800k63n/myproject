# Introduction

A [list][list] is a mutable collection of items in _sequence_.
 Lists can hold reference to any (or multiple) data type(s) - including other lists or data structures such as [tuples][tuples], [sets][sets], or [dicts][dicts].
 Content can be iterated over using `for item in <list>` construct.
 If indexes are needed with the content, `for index, item in enumerate(<list>)` can be used.
 Elements within a `list` can be accessed via `0-based index` number from the left, or `-1-based index` number from the right.
 Lists can be copied in whole or in part using  _slice notation_ or `<list>.copy()`.
 Python provides many useful and convenient [methods][list-methods] for working with lists.
