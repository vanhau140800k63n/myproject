# Installing Python

If Python isn't already available on your system, detailed instructions by platform can be found in the [Python Setup and Usage][using python] section of the official documentation.
Real Python also offers a [nice guide][helpful guide] to installation on various platforms, including iOS and Android.

Finally, these posts by Brett Cannon [A quick-and-dirty guide][quick-and-dirty] and [Why you should use `python -m pip`][python-m-pip], give very helpful advice on how to manage Python installations and packages.

**Note for MacOS users:**  prior to MacOS Monterey (12.3), `Python 2.7` came pre-installed with the operating system.
Using `Python 2.7` with Exercism or most other programs is not supported.
You should instead install [Python 3][Python-three downloads] via one of the methods detailed below.
As of MacOS Monterey (12.3), no version of Python will be pre-installed via MacOS.

Some quick links into the documentation by operating system:

-  [Windows][windows] Additionally, this Microsoft article on [installing Python on windows][python-on-windows] is helpful.
-  [Unix & Linux Systems][unix-and-linux] (_these largely work for MacOS as well_)
-  [MacOS][macos] : **This is outdated.**
   We recommend reviewing some of the methods outlined in the Real Python article [Installing Python][installing-python] or the articles by Brett Cannon linked above.


Exercism tests and tooling currently support `3.7` - `3.11.2` (_tests_) and [`Python 3.11.2`][311-new-features] (_tooling_).
Exceptions to this support are noted where they occur.
Most of the exercises will work with `Python 3.6+`, or even earlier versions.
But we don't guarantee support for versions not listed under [Active Python Releases][active-python-releases].


Please refer to the [Python 3.11.x documentation][3.11 docs] for what is currently supported.
