# Learning

Exercism itself has a nice [learning path for JavaScript](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/concepts).
But in case you need more, here are some resources:

- [Learn JavaScript on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)
- [ES6 Katas](http://es6katas.org)
- [Babel docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/learn/)
