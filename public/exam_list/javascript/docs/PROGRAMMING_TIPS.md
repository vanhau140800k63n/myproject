# Programming Tips

## Naming A Function

Picking good function names is an essential part of writing good code.
Consider the following recommendations when you name your function.

### Choose meaningful function names

When you name your function, you should be clear on what it does.
For example, the function `get(studentId, subject)` doesn't have a meaningful function name, and therefore, it is not clear what it does.
It might be getting the student's subject grade or getting their enrollment status.
A better name would be `getStudentGrade(studentId, subject)`, as it precisely communicates what the function does.

### Don't make the function name too long

Take care not to make a function name too long.
For example, `checkStudentFailOrPassOrMeritOrDistinction(mark)` is an unnecessarily long function name.
The longer the name is, the harder it gets to remember and the more space it takes on the computer screen.

### Don't make the function name too short

Conversely, making a function name too short can also confuse readers.
For example, `checkFPMD(mark)` is a bad function name as it isn't immediately obvious what 'FPMD' means.

### Use the name that everyone understands.

Your function name should be understandable by everyone who reads your code.
For example, an obscure function name like `DeathStar()` might be amusing to you, but the name doesn't communicate its purpose and can cause confusion for other developers who read your code.

### Pick one convention for naming operations

Stick to one convention for naming operations that do the same thing.
For example, if you name the function to get a student's name `getStudentName()`, you should not use a different verb in the function name to get a student's grade (e.g. `retrieveStudentGrade()`).

### Avoid using the same word for two purposes

For example, don't keep using `add` when you want to put a group of items into a collection if you already named it on a addition of two numbers.
Use `insert` or `append` instead.
