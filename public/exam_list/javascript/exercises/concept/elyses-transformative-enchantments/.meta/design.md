# Design

## Learning objectives

- `.map`
- `.reduce`
- `.slice`
- `.splice`
- `.filter`
- `.sort`
- `.reverse`

## Out of scope

- anything that explicitly loops an array (array-loops)
- anything that returns a boolean (array-analysis)
- anything that implicitly loops
  - `indexOf`
  - `find`
  - `findIndex`
  - `includes`
  - etc.
- basic array manipulation (push, pop, etc.)

## Concepts

- `array-transformations`

## Prerequisites

- `arrays` as it covers the basics
- `callbacks` as most methods require a callback
- `arrow-functions` as they are often used to write the callbacks
- `conditionals` because they are needed in the callback functions

## Notes

The introduction for the exercise deliberately does not show how to sort numbers.
If the student attempts to sort without a custom comparison function, the test cases will fail and make them think.
