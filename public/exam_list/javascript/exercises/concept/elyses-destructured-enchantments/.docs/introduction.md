# Introduction

## Array destructuring

JavaScript's array destructuring syntax is a concise way to extract values from an array and assign them to distinct variables.

In this example, each value in the `numberOfMoons` array is assigned to its corresponding planet:

```javascript
const numberOfMoons = [0, 2, 14];
const [venus, mars, neptune] = numberOfMoons;

neptune;
// => 14
```

## Rest and spread

JavaScript has a built-in `...` operator that makes it easier to work with indefinite numbers of elements. Depending on the context, it's called either a _rest operator_ or _spread operator_.

### Rest elements

When `...` appears on the left-hand side of an assignment, those three dots are known as the `rest` operator. The three dots together with a variable name is called a rest element. It collects zero or more values, and stores them into a single array.

```javascript
const [a, b, ...everythingElse] = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8];

everythingElse;
// => [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```

Note that in JavaScript, unlike some other languages, a `rest` element cannot have a trailing comma. It _must_ be the last element in a destructuring assignment.

### Spread elements

When `...` appears on the right-hand side of an assignment, it's known as the `spread` operator. It expands an array into a list of elements. Unlike the rest element, it can appear anywhere in an array literal expression, and there can be more than one.

```javascript
const oneToFive = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const oneToTen = [...oneToFive, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

oneToTen;
// => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
