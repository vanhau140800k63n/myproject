# Introduction

Besides the if-statement, JavaScript also has a switch-statement to conditionally execute logic.
It is used when a single variable needs to be compared to multiple variants.
The comparison is done by checking for strict equality (`===`), see [concept comparison][concept-comparison].
For some variable `x`, the switch statement in JavaScript has the following syntax.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```javascript
switch (x) {
  case option1:
    // code that is executed when "x === option1" is true
    break;
  case option2:
    // code that is executed when "x === option2" is true
    break;
  default:
    // code that is executed when x does not equal any of the options
}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

The `default` case is optional and used when you want to execute some code if none of the other options match the variable.

The `break` statements above are needed because by default all cases are "fallthrough" in JavaScript.
That means that without any `break` statement all the code in the cases below the first matching option would be executed even though `x` did not match those options.
This "fallthrough by default" behavior is a common pitfall when using `switch` in JavaScript.
Inside a function, `return` can also be used instead of `break` to avoid this problem.
